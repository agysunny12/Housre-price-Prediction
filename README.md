The House Price Predictor is a project aimed at forecasting property prices in a
specific region. The project utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze various
factors and patterns present in the real estate market data.By considering factors such
as square footage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, and location, the predictor
aims to provide accurate price estimates for houses in the target area.
The project involves data acquisition from reliable sources, preprocessing to clean
and format the data, and the application of different machine learning techniques to
train and build a predictive model.
The House Price Predictor has the potential to assist home buyers, sellers, and real
estate professionals in making decisions based on estimated property values.
